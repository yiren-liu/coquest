Title: Advancing the art of simulation in the social sciences

Abstract: Advancing the state of the art of simulation in the social sciences requires appreciating the unique value of simulation as a third way of doing science, in contrast to both induction and deduction. This essay offers advice for doing simulation research, focusing on the programming of a simulation model, analyzing the results and sharing the results with others. Replicating other peopleâ€™s simulations gets special emphasis, with examples of the procedures and difficulties involved in the process of replication. Finally, suggestions are offered for building of a community of social scientists who do simulation.

TLDR: Advice is offered on the programming of a simulation model, analyzing the results and sharing the results with others, and suggestions are offered for fostering of a community of social scientists who do simulation.
