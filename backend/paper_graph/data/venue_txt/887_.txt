Title: Stop explaining black box machine learning models for high stakes decisions and use interpretable models instead

Abstract: None

TLDR: This Perspective clarifies the chasm between explaining black boxes and using inherently interpretable models, outlines several key reasons why explainable black boxes should be avoided in high-stakes decisions, identifies challenges to interpretable machine learning, and provides several example applications whereinterpretable models could potentially replace black box models in criminal justice, healthcare and computer vision.
