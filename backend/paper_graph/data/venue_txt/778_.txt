Title: Applied Linear Statistical Models

Abstract: Applied Linear Statistical Models 5e is the long established leading authoritative text and reference on statistical modeling. The text includes brief introductory and review material, and then proceeds through regression and modeling for the first half, and through ANOVA and Experimental Design in the second half. All topics are presented in a precise and clear style supported with solved examples, numbered formulae, graphic illustrations, and "Notes" to provide depth and statistical accuracy and precision. The Fifth edition provides an increased use of computing and graphical analysis throughout, without sacrificing concepts or rigor. In general, the 5e uses larger data sets in examples and exercises, and where methods can be automated within software without loss of understanding, it is so done.

TLDR: Applied Linear Statistical Models 5e uses larger data sets in examples and exercises, and where methods can be automated within software without loss of understanding, it is so done.
