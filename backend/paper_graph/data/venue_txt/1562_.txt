Title: Storytelling for Oppositionists and Others: A Plea for Narrative

Abstract: This is one of the earliest pieces to address legal storytelling or narrative analysis. It explains why it is helpful both to tell and analyze legal stories. A middle section tells a story of a single event – a black lawyer interviews for a position at a top school and is rejected – from several points of view. The article thus is both an exemplar of legal storytelling as well as an effort to analyze and defend the genre.
