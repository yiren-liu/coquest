Title: Triangle: Engineering a 2D Quality Mesh Generator and Delaunay Triangulator

Abstract: None

TLDR: The problem of triangulating a planar straight line graph (PSLG) without introducing new small angles is shown to be impossible for some PSLGs, contradicting the claim that a variant of the Delaunay refinement algorithm solves this problem.
