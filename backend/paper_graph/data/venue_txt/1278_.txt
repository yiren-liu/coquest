Title: Reciprocal n-Body Collision Avoidance

Abstract: None

TLDR: This paper presents a formal approach to reciprocal n-body collision avoidance, where multiple mobile robots need to avoid collisions with each other while moving in a common workspace, and derives sufficient conditions for collision-free motion by reducing the problem to solving a low-dimensional linear program.
