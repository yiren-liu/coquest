Title: Fast Algorithms for Mining Association Rules

Abstract: We consider the problem of discovering association rules between items in a large database of sales transactions. We present two new algorithms for solving thii problem that are fundamentally different from the known algorithms. Empirical evaluation shows that these algorithms outperform the known algorithms by factors ranging from three for small problems to more than an order of magnitude for large problems. We also show how the best features of the two proposed algorithms can be combined into a hybrid algorithm, called AprioriHybrid. Scale-up experiments show that AprioriHybrid scales linearly with the number of transactions. AprioriHybrid also has excellent scale-up properties with respect to the transaction size and the number of items in the database. We present

TLDR: Two new algorithms for solving thii problem that are fundamentally different from the known algorithms are presented and empirical evaluation shows that these algorithms outperform theknown algorithms by factors ranging from three for small problems to more than an order of magnitude for large problems.
