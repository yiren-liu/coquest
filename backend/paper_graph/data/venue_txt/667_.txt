Title: Maximum likelihood from incomplete data via the EM - algorithm plus discussions on the paper

Abstract: Vibratory power unit for vibrating conveyers and screens comprising an asynchronous polyphase motor, at least one pair of associated unbalanced masses disposed on the shaft of said motor, with the first mass of a pair of said unbalanced masses being rigidly fastened to said shaft and with said second mass of said pair being movably arranged relative to said first mass, means for controlling and regulating the conveying rate during conveyer operation by varying the rotational speed of said motor between predetermined minimum and maximum values, said second mass being movably outwardly by centrifugal force against the pressure of spring means, said spring means being prestressed in such a manner that said second mass is, at rotational motor speeds lower than said minimum speed, held in its initial position, and at motor speeds between said lower and upper values in positions which are radially offset with respect to the axis of said motor to an extent depending on the value of said rotational motor speed.
