Title: Encoder-Decoder with Atrous Separable Convolution for Semantic Image Segmentation

Abstract: None

TLDR: This work extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries and applies the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network.
