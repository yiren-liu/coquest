Title: How Maps Work - Representation, Visualization, and Design

Abstract: Part 1 How meaning is derived from maps: taking a scientific approach in improving map representation and design an information processing view of vision and visual cognition - cartographic implications how maps are seen how maps are understood. Part 2 How maps are imbued with meaning: a Primer On Semiotics For Understanding Map Representation A Functional approach to map representation - semantics and syntactics of map signs a lexical approach to map representation - map pragmatics. Part 3 How maps are used - applications in geographical visualization: GVIS - facilitating visual thinking GVIS - relationship in space and time GVIS - should we believe what we see.

TLDR: Part 1 How meaning is derived from maps: taking a scientific approach in improving map representation and design an information processing view of vision and visual cognition - cartographic implications how Maps are seen how maps are understood.
