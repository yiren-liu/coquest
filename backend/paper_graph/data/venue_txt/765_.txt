Title: SMOG Grading - A New Readability Formula.

Abstract: in a recent issue of this journal, Fry (4) described "a readability formula that saves time." The panel immediately below gives a method of assessing readability which is even quicker and so simple that one statistician who glanced at an earlier version of this paper thought that it was a "put on," a fake. Although this system, SMOG Grading, is laughably simple, it is in fact more valid than previous readability formulas. The rest of this paper is devoted to substantiating that claim.

TLDR: Although this system, SMOG Grading, is laughably simple, it is in fact more valid than previous readability formulas and the rest of this paper is devoted to substantiating that claim.
