Title: Unpacking "privacy" for a networked world

Abstract: Although privacy is broadly recognized as a dominant concern for the development of novel interactive technologies, our ability to reason analytically about privacy in real settings is limited. A lack of conceptual interpretive frameworks makes it difficult to unpack interrelated privacy issues in settings where information technology is also present. Building on theory developed by social psychologist Irwin Altman, we outline a model of privacy as a dynamic, dialectic process. We discuss three tensions that govern interpersonal privacy management in everyday life, and use these to explore select technology case studies drawn from the research literature. These suggest new ways for thinking about privacy in socio-technical environments as a practical matter.

TLDR: A model of privacy as a dynamic, dialectic process is outlined, and three tensions that govern interpersonal privacy management in everyday life are discussed, and these are used to explore select technology case studies drawn from the research literature.
