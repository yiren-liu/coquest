Title: advertising value and advertising on the web-Blog

Abstract: The growth of advertising on the World Wide Web requires research on users' general perceptions since these affect attitudes toward individual advertisements. This article presents results of an intercept survey focusing on the perceived value of Web advertising, an approach developed by the author for assessing advertising in the general media. Both the hypothesized model of advertising value and its role as an antecedent of overall audience attitudes are confirmed. The author maintains that advertising value is a useful measurement criterion for evaluating advertising effects generally, and particularly in the case of the Web. ROBERT H.
