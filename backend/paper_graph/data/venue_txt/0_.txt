Title: Independent Component Analysis

Abstract: In this chapter, we discuss a statistical generative model called independent component analysis. It is basically a proper probabilistic formulation of the ideas underpinning sparse coding. It shows how sparse coding can be interpreted as providing a Bayesian prior, and answers some questions which were not properly answered in the sparse coding framework.
