Title: Likert scales: how to (ab)use them

Abstract: Dipping my toe into the water of educational research, I have recently used Likert-type rating scales to measure student views on various educational interventions. Likert scales are commonly used to measure attitude, providing a range of responses to a given question or statement . Typically, there are 5 categories of response, from (for example) 1 1⁄4 strongly disagree to 5 1⁄4 strongly agree, although there are arguments in favour of scales with 7 or with an even number of response categories.

TLDR: I have recently used Likert-type rating scales to measure student views on various educational interventions, providing a range of responses to a given question or statement.
