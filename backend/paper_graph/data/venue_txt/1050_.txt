Title: Wireless Power Transfer via Strongly Coupled Magnetic Resonances

Abstract: Using self-resonant coils in a strongly coupled regime, we experimentally demonstrated efficient nonradiative power transfer over distances up to 8 times the radius of the coils. We were able to transfer 60 watts with ∼40% efficiency over distances in excess of 2 meters. We present a quantitative model describing the power transfer, which matches the experimental results to within 5%. We discuss the practical applicability of this system and suggest directions for further study.

TLDR: A quantitative model is presented describing the power transfer of self-resonant coils in a strongly coupled regime, which matches the experimental results to within 5%.
