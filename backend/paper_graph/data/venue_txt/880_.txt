Title: PDDL-the planning domain definition language

Abstract: This manual describes the syntax of PDDL, the Planning Domain Definition Language, the problem-specification language for the AIPS-98 planning competition. The language has roughly the the expressiveness of Pednaultâ€™s ADL [10] for propositions, and roughly the expressiveness of UMCP [6] for actions. Our hope is to encourage empirical evaluation of planner performance, and development of standard sets of problems all in comparable notations.

TLDR: This manual describes the syntax of PDDL, the Planning Domain Definition Language, the problem-specification language for the AIPS-98 planning competition, and hopes to encourage empirical evaluation of planner performance, and development of standard sets of problems all in comparable notations.
