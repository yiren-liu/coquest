Title: Graph drawing by force‐directed placement

Abstract: We present a modification of the spring‐embedder model of Eades [Congressus Numerantium, 42, 149–160, (1984)] for drawing undirected graphs with straight edges. Our heuristic strives for uniform edge lengths, and we develop it in analogy to forces in natural systems, for a simple, elegant, conceptually‐intuitive, and efficient algorithm.

TLDR: A modification of the spring‐embedder model of Eades for drawing undirected graphs with straight edges is presented, developed in analogy to forces in natural systems, for a simple, elegant, conceptually‐intuitive, and efficient algorithm.
