Title: Automatic generation and detection of highly reliable fiducial markers under occlusion

Abstract: None

TLDR: A fiducial marker system specially appropriated for camera pose estimation in applications such as augmented reality and robot localization is presented and an algorithm for generating configurable marker dictionaries following a criterion to maximize the inter-marker distance and the number of bit transitions is proposed.
