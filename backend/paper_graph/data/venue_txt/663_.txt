Title: Bayesian Experimental Design: A Review

Abstract: This paper reviews the literature on Bayesian experimental design, both for linear and nonlinear models. A uniied view of the topic is presented by putting experimental design in a decision theoretic framework. This framework justiies many optimality criteria, and opens new possibilities. Various design criteria become part of a single, coherent approach.
