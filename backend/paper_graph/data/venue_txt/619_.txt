Title: Communicating sequential processes

Abstract: This paper suggests that input and output are basic primitives of programming and that parallel composition of communicating sequential processes is a fundamental program structuring method. When combined with a development of Dijkstra's guarded command, these concepts are surprisingly versatile. Their use is illustrated by sample solutions of a variety of a familiar programming exercises.

TLDR: It is suggested that input and output are basic primitives of programming and that parallel composition of communicating sequential processes is a fundamental program structuring method.
