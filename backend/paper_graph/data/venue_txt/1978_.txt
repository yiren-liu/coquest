TLDR: This paper surveys the landscape of actual and possible hybrid recommenders, and introduces a novel hybrid, EntreeC, a system that combines knowledge-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend restaurants, and shows that semantic ratings obtained from the knowledge- based part of the system enhance the effectiveness of collaborative filtering.
