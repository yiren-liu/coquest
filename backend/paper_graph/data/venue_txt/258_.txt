Title: Basic Emotions

Abstract: determining not only that they pertain to emotion, but to which emotion . . . Appraisal is not always automatic. Sometimes the evaluation of what is happening is slow, deliberate and conscious. With such a more extended appraisal there may be some autonomic arousal, but perhaps not of a kind which is differentiated. The person could be said to be aroused or alerted, but no specific emotion is operative. Cognition plays the important role in determining what will transpire. During such extended appraisal the evaluation may match to the selective filters of the automatic appraiser . . . . It need not be, however; the experience may be diffuse rather than specific to one emotion” (pp. 58—59).
