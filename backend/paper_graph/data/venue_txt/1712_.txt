Title: A Practical Guide to Support Vector Classication

Abstract: Support vector machine (SVM) is a popular technique for classication. However, beginners who are not familiar with SVM often get unsatisfactory results since they miss some easy but signicant steps. In this guide, we propose a simple procedure, which usually gives reasonable results.

TLDR: A simple procedure is proposed, which usually gives reasonable results and is suitable for beginners who are not familiar with SVM.
