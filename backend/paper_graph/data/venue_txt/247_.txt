Title: Single-Pixel Imaging via Compressive Sampling

Abstract: In this article, the authors present a new approach to building simpler, smaller, and cheaper digital cameras that can operate efficiently across a broader spectral range than conventional silicon-based cameras. The approach fuses a new camera architecture based on a digital micromirror device with the new mathematical theory and algorithms of compressive sampling.

TLDR: A new camera architecture based on a digital micromirror device with the new mathematical theory and algorithms of compressive sampling is presented that can operate efficiently across a broader spectral range than conventional silicon-based cameras.
