Title: VISUAL SEARCH.

Abstract: In a standard visual search paradigm, participants look for a target item among a number of distractor items. The total number of item in the display is known as the set size. Typically, the target is present 50 % of the time. On the other trials, only distractors are presented. The dependent measures that are used are reaction time (RT) and accuracy. Reaction time is analyzed as a function of set size.

TLDR: In a standard visual search paradigm, participants look for a target item among a number of distractor items and reaction time is analyzed as a function of set size.
