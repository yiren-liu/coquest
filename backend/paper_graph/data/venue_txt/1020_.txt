Title: A rationale and test for the number of factors in factor analysis

Abstract: None

TLDR: It is suggested that if Guttman's latent-root-one lower bound estimate for the rank of a correlation matrix is accepted as a psychometric upper bound, then the rank for a sample matrix should be estimated by subtracting out the component in the latent roots which can be attributed to sampling error.
