Title: A theory of learning from different domains

Abstract: None

TLDR: A classifier-induced divergence measure that can be estimated from finite, unlabeled samples from the domains and shows how to choose the optimal combination of source and target error as a function of the divergence, the sample sizes of both domains, and the complexity of the hypothesis class.
