Title: The episodic buffer: a new component of working memory?

Abstract: None

TLDR: The revised model differs from the old principally in focussing attention on the processes of integrating information, rather than on the isolation of the subsystems, which provides a better basis for tackling the more complex aspects of executive control in working memory.

Fields of Study: ['Psychology', 'Medicine']
