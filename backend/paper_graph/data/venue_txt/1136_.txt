Title: Robust wide-baseline stereo from maximally stable extremal regions

Abstract: None

TLDR: The wide-baseline stereo problem, i.e. the problem of establishing correspondences between a pair of images taken from different viewpoints, is studied and an efficient and practically fast detection algorithm is presented for an affinely-invariant stable subset of extremal regions, the maximally stable extremal region (MSER).
