Title: Counseling Adults in Transition: Linking Practice with Theory

Abstract: "Dr. Schlossberg has done a creative piece of work in first reviewing human development and transition theory and then relating it to an intervention and helping model. Perhaps most important, however, is the large void in the counseling literature that this book helps to fill. That is, it provides a theoretical and application model for counseling adults...It should be in every counselor of adults' library." - G.M. Gazda, EdD. In this fully updated edition of a highly successful text, the authors expand on their transition model, which offers effective adult counseling through an integration of empirical knowledge and theory with practice. The authors combine an understanding of adult development with practical strategies for counseling clients in personal and professional transition. A framework is provided for individual, group, and work settings. The final chapter goes beyond intervention to discuss issues such as consulting and advocacy. Counselors, counselor educators, counselors-in-training, and other mental health professionals will find this volume an essential addition to their library of resources.
