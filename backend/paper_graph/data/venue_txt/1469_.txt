Title: Grad-CAM: Visual Explanations from Deep Networks via Gradient-Based Localization

Abstract: None

TLDR: This work proposes a technique for producing ‘visual explanations’ for decisions from a large class of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models, making them more transparent and explainable, and shows that even non-attention based models learn to localize discriminative regions of input image.
