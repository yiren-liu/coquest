Title: Marker tracking and HMD calibration for a video-based augmented reality conferencing system

Abstract: We describe an augmented reality conferencing system which uses the overlay of virtual images on the real world. Remote collaborators are represented on virtual monitors which can be freely positioned about a user in space. Users can collaboratively view and interact with virtual objects using a shared virtual whiteboard. This is possible through precise virtual image registration using fast and accurate computer vision techniques and head mounted display (HMD) calibration. We propose a method for tracking fiducial markers and a calibration method for optical see-through HMD based on the marker tracking.

TLDR: An augmented reality conferencing system which uses the overlay of virtual images on the real world using fast and accurate computer vision techniques and head mounted display (HMD) calibration is described.
