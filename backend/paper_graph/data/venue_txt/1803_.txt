Title: Calculating, Interpreting, And Reporting Cronbachâ€™s Alpha Reliability Coefficient For Likert-Type Scales

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to show why single-item questions pertaining to a construct are not reliable and should not be used in drawing conclusions. By comparing the reliability of a summated, multi-item scale versus a single-item question, the authors show how unreliable a single item is; and therefore it is not appropriate to make inferences based upon the analysis of single-item questions which are used in measuring a construct.
