Title: Local Features and Kernels for Classification of Texture and Object Categories: A Comprehensive Study

Abstract: None

TLDR: A large-scale evaluation of an approach that represents images as distributions of features extracted from a sparse set of keypoint locations and learns a Support Vector Machine classifier with kernels based on two effective measures for comparing distributions, the Earth Mover’s Distance and the χ2 distance.
