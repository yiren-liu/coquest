Title: All in a Day'S Work: Boundaries and Micro Role Transitions

Abstract: We focus on everyday role transitions involving home, work, and other places. Transitions are boundary-crossing activities, where one exits and enters roles by surmounting role boundaries. Roles can be arrayed on a continuum, spanning high segmentation to high integration. Segmentation decreases role blurring but increases the magnitude of change, rendering boundary crossing more difficult; crossing often is facilitated by rites of passage. Integration decreases the magnitude of change but increases blurring, rendering boundary creation and maintenance more difficult; this challenge often is surmounted by boundary work.

TLDR: Everyday role transitions involving home, work, and other places is focused on boundary-crossing activities, where one exits and enters roles by surmounting role boundaries, spanning high segmentation to high integration.
