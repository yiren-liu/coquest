Title: Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification

Abstract: This article offers an empirical exploration on the use of character-level convolutional networks (ConvNets) for text classification. We constructed several large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results. Comparisons are offered against traditional models such as bag of words, n-grams and their TFIDF variants, and deep learning models such as word-based ConvNets and recurrent neural networks.

TLDR: This article constructed several large-scale datasets to show that character-level convolutional networks could achieve state-of-the-art or competitive results in text classification.
