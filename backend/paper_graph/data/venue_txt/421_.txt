Title: Robust Real-Time Face Detection

Abstract: None

TLDR: A new image representation called the “Integral Image” is introduced which allows the features used by the detector to be computed very quickly and a method for combining classifiers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising face-like regions.
