Title: Users are not the enemy

Abstract: Many system security departments treat users as a security risk to be controlled. The general consensus is that most users are careless and unmotivated when it comes to system security. In a recent study, we found that users may indeed compromise computer security mechanisms, such as password authentication, both knowing and unknowingly. A closer analysis, however, revealed that such behavior is often caused by the way in which security mechanisms are implemented, and usersâ€™ lack of knowledge. We argue that to change this state of affairs, security departments need to communicate more with users, and adopt a usercentered design approach.

TLDR: It is argued that to change this state of affairs, security departments need to communicate more with users, and adopt a usercentered design approach.
