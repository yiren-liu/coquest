Title: Riemannian Walk for Incremental Learning: Understanding Forgetting and Intransigence

Abstract: None

TLDR: This work introduces two metrics to quantify forgetting and intransigence that allow for better insights into the behaviour of IL algorithms and presents RWalk, a generalization of EWC++ and Path Integral with a theoretically grounded KL-divergence based perspective.
