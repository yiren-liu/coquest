Title: U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation

Abstract: None

TLDR: It is shown that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks.
