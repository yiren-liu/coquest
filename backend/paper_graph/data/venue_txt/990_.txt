Title: The Mythos of Model Interpretability

Abstract: Supervised machine-learning models boast remarkable predictive capabilities. But can you trust your model? Will it work in deployment? What else can it tell you about the world?

TLDR: This research presents a meta-modelling architecture that automates the very labor-intensive and therefore time-heavy and expensive and therefore expensive and expensive process of training and deploying supervised machine-learning models.
