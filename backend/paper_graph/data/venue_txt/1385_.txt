Title: Improving predictive inference under covariate shift by weighting the log-likelihood function

Abstract: None

TLDR: A class of predictive densities is derived by weighting the observed samples in maximizing the log-likelihood function, effective in cases such as sample surveys or design of experiments, where the observed covariate follows a different distribution than that in the whole population.
