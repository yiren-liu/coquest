Title: Fast Effective Rule Induction

Abstract: None

TLDR: This paper evaluates the recently-proposed rule learning algorithm IREP on a large and diverse collection of benchmark problems, and proposes a number of modifications resulting in an algorithm RIPPERk that is very competitive with C4.5 and C 4.5rules with respect to error rates, but much more efficient on large samples.
