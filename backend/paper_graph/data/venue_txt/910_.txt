Title: Jupyter Notebooks - a publishing format for reproducible computational workflows

Abstract: It is increasingly necessary for researchers in all fields to write computer code, and in order to reproduce research results, it is important that this code is published. We present Jupyter notebooks, a document format for publishing code, results and explanations in a form that is both readable and executable. We discuss various tools and use cases for notebook documents.

TLDR: Jupyter notebooks, a document format for publishing code, results and explanations in a form that is both readable and executable, is presented.
